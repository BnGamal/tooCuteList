## Urgent Problems:
1. make the focus on the title of the prompt when it shows up
2. the logo goes right when the 'menu' button changes it's text to 'close' since it's somehow shorter.
## Problems to Solve:
1. Change the carousel tasks areas, they look awful.
2. Made another uneccessary div for the carousel overflow.
3. Change the landing tasks' text.
4. The padding-top/margin-top of the element under the logo is not dynamic.
5. Change `querySelector` with `getElementById`, using multiple html files it's hard to choose specific elements.
6. title doesn't perserve it's place when it's empty and the paragraph is not empty
7. make the 'not functional yet' hover effect follow the cursor
## Want to Add:
1. Cosider the timeline of the task added (prepend vs append).
2. Scroll on task to make a flip animation that makes that task marked as "done".
2. Make 'guide tour' on how to use the website.
3. Change the logo everytime (a task get's done/deleted/edited) or when the logo is actually clicked.
4. Add the date at which every task was created
5. Total number of tasks and % of how many is "done"
6. Add the arabic version
7. Add theme button
8. get back a list of the deleted tasks (in case you want to undo)
9. repeatable tasks
